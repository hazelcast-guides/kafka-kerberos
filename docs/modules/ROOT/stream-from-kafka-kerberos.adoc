== Context

When Kafka brokers are secured with Kerberos authentication, your Hazelcast cluster must acquire session keys from the Kerberos server before the Hazelcast cluster can communicate with the Kafka brokers.

In this example, you'll learn how to configure the Hazelcast Kafka connector to connect to a Kafka broker that's secured with Kerberos authentication.

== Before you Begin

Before starting this tutorial, make sure that you have the following prerequisites:

* link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose]
* link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git]
* xref:hazelcast:deploy:versioning-compatibility.adoc[JDK 8 - 11]
* link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven]
* Knowledge of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)[Kerberos]
* Knowledge of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Kafka[Kafka]

== Step 1. Clone the Project

To set up the project, you need to download the code from GitHub.

Clone the GitHub repository.

== Step 2. Start the Docker Containers

In this step, you'll use Docker Compose to start all the Docker containers, including a Kafka broker, Kerberos server, Hazelcast Platform, and Management Center.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The Docker containers are running in detatched mode. You can see that they are running, using the following command:

```
docker ps
```

To see the logs of your Hazelcast member, use the following command:

```
docker logs hazelcast
```

You should see that you have a single member running in the cluster.

```
Members {size:1, ver:1} [
	Member [172.19.0.4]:5701 - 15116025-342b-43c0-83f7-a2a90f0281ce this
]
```

== Step 3. Create a Kafka Topic

To create a Kafka topic, you'll use the `kafka-console-producer` script that's built into the Kafka broker.

Create the `orders` topic and add some records to it.

```bash
docker exec -i broker kafka-console-producer --broker-list broker:9092 --topic orders < orders.jsonl --producer.config /etc/kafka/kafka-client.properties
```

The `kafka-client.properties` file contains the Kafka client configuration that allows Kerberos to authenticate Kafka clients. The Kafka clients assume the `jduke@KERBEROS.EXAMPLE` SPN (service principal name), which is registered on the Kerberos server.

== Step 4. Connect Hazelcast to the Kafka Broker

Now that your Kafka topic has some records, you can configure the Kafka connector in Hazelcast to consume those records. In this step, you'll create a Jet job that reads from the Kafka topic and writes the data to a Hazelcast map called `sink_orders`. This Kafka connector is configured to assume the same SPN as the producer in the previous step.

. Change into the `jet-pipeline` directory.

. Package the Java file into a JAR.
+
```bash
mvn package
```

. Submit the JAR to your Hazelcast member. Replace the `$PATH_TO_PROJECT` placeholder with the absolute path to the `kafka-kerberos` directory.
+
```bash
docker run -it --network kafka-kerberos_default -v $PATH_TO_PROJECT/jet-pipeline/target:/jars --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:5.1.4  hz-cli -t hazelcast:5701 submit -c com.example.hazelcast.jet.kafka.KafkaSourceWithClientServerHazelcast /jars/jet-kafka-1.0.0.jar
```

You should see the following in the console:

```
Submitting JAR '/jars/jet-kafka-1.0.0.jar' with arguments []
Orders added to map
===================
```

Your Hazelcast cluster connects to the Kerberos server, acquires a session key and reads records from the `orders` topic. Your Hazelcast cluster now contains a map called `sink_orders` that contains the orders.

== Step 5. Verify that the Connection Succeeded

In this step, you'll verify that the Kerberos server authenticated Hazelcast and the Kafka broker allowed the Hazelcast Kafka connector to read from the `orders` topic.

. Go to `localhost:8080` and enable dev mode in Management Center.

. Open the SQL Browser.

. In the *select a map* dropdown, select *sink_orders (No SQL Mapping)* to auto-generate the `CREATE MAPPING` command.

. Click *Execute Query*

. Delete the previous command from the SQL editor and enter the following:
+
```sql
SELECT * FROM sink_orders;
```

. Click *Execute Query*.

The `sink_orders` map contains all the records in the `orders` topic.
